# Mellea — build predictable AI without guesswork

<!-- leothomas, please delete this line -->

Inside every AI-powered pipeline, the unreliable part is the same: the LLM call itself.
Silent failures, untestable outputs, no guarantees.
Mellea is a Python library for writing *generative programs* — replacing brittle prompts and flaky agents
with structured, testable AI workflows built around type-annotated outputs, verifiable requirements, and automatic retries.

## Install

```bash
uv pip install mellea
```

See [installation docs](https://docs.mellea.ai/getting-started/installation) for additional options, such as installing all extras via `uv pip install 'mellea[all]'`.
For source installation directly from this repo, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Example

The `@generative` decorator turns a typed Python function into a structured LLM call.
Docstrings become prompts, type hints become schemas — no templates, no parsers:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mellea import generative, start_session

class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

@generative
def extract_user(text: str) -> UserProfile:
    """Extract the user's name and age from the text."""

m = start_session()
user = extract_user(m, text="User log 42: Alice is 31 years old.")
print(user.name)  # Alice
print(user.age)   # 31 — always an int, guaranteed by the schema
```

`start_session()` is the convenience entry point: it returns a `MelleaSession`
with sensible defaults you can override as needed.

## What Mellea Does

- **Structured output** — `@generative` turns typed functions into LLM calls; Pydantic schemas are enforced at generation time
- **Requirements & repair** — attach natural-language requirements to any call; Mellea validates and retries automatically
- **Sampling strategies** — run a generation multiple times and pick the best result; swap between rejection sampling, majority voting, and more with one parameter change
- **Multiple backends** — Ollama, OpenAI, HuggingFace, WatsonX, LiteLLM, Bedrock
- **Legacy integration** — easily drop Mellea into existing codebases with `mify`
- **MCP compatible** — expose any generative program as an MCP tool
